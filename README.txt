  This program is being used to train and test an artificial intelligence
to determine weather a presented photo contains a man, or woman.

Steps To Run:
    1) open ReadFile.py and look for a variable called "path". At the time of
          writing this the path variable holds the value

                "Facial Recognition/points_22"

          This value must be changed to where ever you have the directory
            labeled "points_22" as the program will try and read all of the files
            held within this directory.

    2) Once the path is changed to the proper path you can go to the python file
      called "Male or Female.py" and execute the program.

      --> if running from command prompt/terminal you must navigate to this directory and
          execute the file by simply typing "Male or Female.py" (Quotes included)

    3) Last but not least all important values will be printed to a console window
      for easy reading.
